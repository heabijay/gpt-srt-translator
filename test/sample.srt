1
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,650
I've experienced death so many times.

2
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,530
<i>But never my own.</i>

3
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,236
<i>Talk to me.</i>

4
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,067
We have penetrating thoracic trauma

5
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,220
by gunshot, catastrophic blood loss.

6
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,470
We're losing him. Defib on my count.

7
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,680
Three. Two. One. Clear.

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,876
No pulse. Recharging.

9
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,030
Three. Two. One. Clear.

10
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,716
We have a heartbeat.

11
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,570
<i>A beating heart. I'll take it.</i>

12
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,986
<i>It really is like they say,</i>

13
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,890
<i>your life flashes before your eyes.</i>

14
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,456
My god. My god.

15
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,296
All right, we're at

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,256
ten centimeters dilated. It's crowning.

17
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,716
Keep pushing.

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,126
That's it.

19
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,610
Keep pushing. You're doing great.

20
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,780
Big push. One last one.

21
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,596
Time of birth, 2300 hours, 21 minutes.

22
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,606
February 1, 1971.

23
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,670
Congratulations. It's a boy.

24
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,446
<i>And in the beginning... There was blood.</i>

25
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,220
What're you gonna name
your son, miss moser?

26
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,206
Dexter.

27
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,400
His name is Dexter.

28
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,360
Yeah.

29
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,850
Trying to cop a feel, freak?

30
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,190
I'm experiencing death.

31
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,426
You only get one first time.

32
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,086
Dude, what fucking planet you from?

33
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,506
That's enough.

34
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,450
Let Dexter focus.

35
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,656
Problem?

36
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,826
<i>Yeah, no blood.</i>

37
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,140
No problem.

38
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,806
<i>Heartless. Like the tin man.</i>

39
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,670
<i>And maybe... like me.</i>

40
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,936
Impeccable work as always, Dexter.

41
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,066
You're gonna make an
excellent surgeon one day.

42
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,196
I've been preparing for today
for such a long time, but

43
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,486
I didn't feel... anything.

44
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,680
That's what makes you special.

45
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,060
<i>That's what makes me me.</i>

46
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,126
It's traditional to smile.

47
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,386
I wasn't smiling?

48
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,330
Just think of something
that makes you happy.

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,130
Motherfucker.

50
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,810
Goddamn it.

51
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,076
Sergeant Morgan.

52
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,246
Captain Spencer.

53
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,836
What the fuck? And who the fuck?

54
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,506
We're asking the same questions.
Right now, it's all preliminary.

55
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,586
- Well, I am all ears.
- Stop.

56
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,346
Until forensics is done with our sweep,

57
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,006
you are all guests at my crime scene.

58
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,676
Even you, captain. Bootie up.

59
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,556
Yes, ma'am.

60
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,346
All right. What do you got?

61
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,266
Looks like the intruder used
a box cutter to gain entry

62
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,556
through the back screen porch.

63
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,776
Yeah, he shot the parents, point blank,

64
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,106
and the little girl in the
back as she ran for the stairs.

65
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,236
Then pilfered everything in sight.

66
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,816
Cash, jewelry, cards.

67
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,866
You said "intruder," as in
there was only one perp?

68
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,246
Based on the muddy
footprints all over the place,

69
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,666
only one. Experienced, prepared.

70
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,996
Wore booties over shoes.

71
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,536
Ergo, no tread marks to trace.

72
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,286
You're giving me a
whole lot of nothing here.

73
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,400
A family is dead. What do we have?

74
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,966
Hey, officer Sanders, was the
TV on when you arrived here?

75
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,967
Negative, sergeant.

76
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,426
All right, so this poor family,

77
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,460
they're chowing down,
watching television...

78
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
The intruder turns it off.

79
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm seeing blood on the "on/off" switch.

80
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,116
Masuka, when you're done

81
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,406
with the other 700 things going on here,

82
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,536
would you run this for prints?

83
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,890
It'll be number 701, sergeant.

84
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,676
Could've at least killed
the fucking cow first.

85
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,516
And you could at least not
curse at the dinner table.

86
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,830
Sorry. It's just how it comes out.

87
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,186
So, graduation's in a week.
Anything fun happening?

88
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,106
I heard about some party
at delta Alpha something.

89
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,196
But I'm not going.

90
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,566
I'll represent. Show the world

91
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,946
there's at least one Morgan with a life.

92
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,696
You're going to a college party?

93
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,826
Dad, come on. We both
know that you're gonna say no,

94
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,746
I'm gonna go anyway, and
the world isn't gonna end,

95
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,560
so why don't we just
skip the drama for once?

96
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,336
- I'm okay with you going.
- Seriously?

97
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,216
One condition. You take your brother.

98
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,886
- What?
- What?

99
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,216
You need to get out more,

100
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,966
spend time with people your own age.

101
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,426
Be a part of something.

102
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,136
Yes, he should do that,
but far away from me.

103
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,726
- It's my one condition.
- Unbelievable.

104
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,330
- Hey.
- Fuck me.

105
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,236
So how'd it go yesterday?

106
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,236
Dr. Rivas said I did a good job.

107
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,906
Well, that's great, right?

108
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,736
I guess.

109
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,026
But...

110
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,076
It didn't give me the
feeling I thought it would.

111
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,206
I know we hoped slicing
into bodies would be enough.

112
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,350
But i-I'm still

113
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,650
hungry.

114
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,336
Just stick with the plan.

115
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,086
Four years of med
school, then a residency.

116
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,926
We have plenty of
time to figure all this out.

117
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,466
No, I don't know. I-I'm worried the plan

118
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,056
isn't going to satisfy my... urges.

119
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,790
It has to.

120
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,956
You guys have a good day.

121
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,626
<i>All those shiny, happy people.</i>

122
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,530
<i>So excited to plan their lives.</i>

123
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,990
<i>And all I wanted to do was end one.</i>

124
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,436
Are those real dead bodies?

125
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,816
Kind of cool, right?

126
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,970
Name's masuka, look me up if
you ever get a speeding ticket.

127
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,930
Nice booth.

128
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,246
My father actually
works for Miami Metro.

129
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,376
Harry Morgan. You know him?

130
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,126
Come on, baby, come to daddy.

131
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,376
Want to see my nine-inch nail?

132
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,900
Really? Poser.

133
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,766
Hey, are number seven and
number 12 the same killer?

134
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,436
What? No.

135
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,776
Can you move? You're
cock blocking my booth.

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,420
Shoo.

137
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,576
This is starting to look like

138
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,116
a serial killer art project up in here.

139
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,576
And we are the parents

140
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,916
displaying it on our fucking fridge!

141
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,956
I'm not a proud mama, fellas.

142
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,676
I am one pissed-off, menopausal bitch.

143
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,636
We have three home
invasion sites in three counties.

144
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,886
Eight dead, including two children.

145
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,766
I will not and I cannot wait
for the next one to happen.

146
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,396
Do you understand me?

147
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,976
- Yes, captain.
- Yes, captain.

148
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,936
- I got something.
- Thank fucking god.

149
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,726
Okay, that partial we
took off that VCR remote

150
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,566
gave us four hits.

151
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,316
This guy's in prison.

152
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,526
Deceased.

153
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,906
Five-foot-four.

154
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,656
And then there's him. Levi Reed.

155
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,576
Extensive b&e jacket.

156
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,956
Plus, he's six-three, which matches

157
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,666
the muddy footprints
we found on the scene.

158
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,996
The only way we're gonna
stop this is if we bust his ass.

159
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,150
Alert SWAT. We are doing this now.

160
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,290
Hey. See if the door's open first.

161
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,500
- Clear.
- Clear.

162
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,430
Downstairs is clear.

163
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,890
Got him!

164
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,956
Yo. Shoes.

165
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,456
You killed two kids. Fuck you.

166
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,126
Fuck your shoes.
Get him out of my face.

167
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,820
Come on. This way.

168
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,386
<i>Before I actually did the deed,</i>

169
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,936
<i>I spent a lot of time fantasizing about it.</i>

170
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,226
<i>Dreaming about a world of possibilities.</i>

171
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,356
<i>But at the tender age
of 20, I was still a virgin.</i>

172
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,236
<i>Ted Bundy.</i>

173
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,646
<i>The most charming man in the world.</i>

174
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,986
<i>And one of the most
prolific serial killers ever.</i>

175
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,746
<i>Adept at blending in, until he wasn't.</i>

176
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,996
<i>I wondered if I was like him.</i>

177
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,286
<i>Or the night stalker.</i>

178
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,850
<i>Or btk.</i>

179
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,110
<i>Or even the zodiac killer.</i>

180
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,876
<i>I even wondered if I'd end
up with a nickname, too.</i>

181
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,610
Time to go.

182
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,846
It's not what you think.

183
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,596
How about you shove
that nudie magazine

184
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,476
underneath your pillow
and join me in the real world

185
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,476
where real women with
real tits actually exist?

186
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,856
If you and dad say so.

187
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,436
Who knows? You might even
meet someone and have fun.

188
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,236
I have fun.

189
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,776
Choking your chicken doesn't count.

190
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,470
Come on. You're driving, I'm drinking.

191
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,717
My god!

192
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:32,926
- Sophia.
- Deb.

193
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,096
Why is your brother here?

194
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,176
Our father made her bring me.

195
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,436
Okay... So, what do I do?

196
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,976
Disappear for two hours.

197
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,090
Don't talk to me until I need a ride home.

198
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,616
Debra Morgan. Badass.

199
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,706
I'm just getting started. Where's the keg?

200
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,150
Keg? We can do better.

201
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,086
Tequila. Seltzer.

202
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,910
And slam.

203
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,790
Is that all you got?

204
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,436
<i>Harry wanted me to get out,</i>

205
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,220
<i>to be with people my own age.</i>

206
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,616
<i>Be a part of something.</i>

207
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,786
<i>Was this really what he meant?</i>

208
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,680
<i>It all seemed so</i>

209
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,440
<i>unsanitary.</i>

210
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,810
Hey, handsome.

211
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,320
<i>Extremely unsanitary.</i>

212
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,466
- Gay? Not interested? What?
- Girlfriend.

213
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,830
Do you have any x?

214
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,476
I tried to stop them,
but the door's locked.

215
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,806
- Who?
- Deb and Andy.

216
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,767
Sh-sh-she was drinking, like a lot,

217
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,106
like, like blacked out,

218
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,646
- and he took her upstairs.
- Which room?

219
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,010
Second floor, first on the left.

220
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,510
Hey! Watch it, bro.

221
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,260
Kind of busy in here.

222
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,850
- Deb!
- Dude! Get the fuck out of here!

223
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,450
What's your deal, asshole?

224
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,656
Go home, you fucking psycho.

225
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,576
Take your slut sister with you.

226
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,666
The fuck was that, Dex?

227
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,956
I was just trying to protect you.

228
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,086
By publicly humiliating me?

229
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,916
You were unconscious in his room.

230
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,256
I had too much to drink.

231
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,886
He said that I could lie down in there.

232
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,676
When I got there, the door was locked

233
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,200
and his pants were off.

234
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,710
Did he...?

235
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,226
- No.
- Deb!

236
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,726
I was so scared. Are you okay?

237
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,396
I will be.

238
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,130
Dex got there before anything happened.

239
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,486
I used to make fun of you

240
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,196
for watching wrestlemania all the time,

241
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,100
but that in there, that was... wow.

242
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,286
Shit.

243
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,876
It's already past curfew.

244
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,746
Go. I got it.

245
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,086
You're a lifesaver, again.

246
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,730
Deb, I'll call you tomorrow?

247
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,070
Hold my fucking hair back.

248
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,066
Hey. Tylenol, water, bed.

249
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,976
And quietly.

250
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,500
I know.

251
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,970
Way past curfew, kids.

252
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,826
How was the party?

253
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,946
- It was...
- you were right.

254
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,656
Yeah, I'm glad I went.

255
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,980
Made lots of friends.

256
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,110
Go to bed.

257
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,636
Sorry to keep you up, dad.

258
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,330
I know we're supposed to
go hunting in a few hours.

259
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,250
I can't sleep unless I know my
kids are home safe and sound.

260
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,460
Get some rest.

261
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,666
<i>Well, this game has certainly</i>

262
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,336
- <i>lived up to the hype.
- Come on, come on.</i>

263
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,167
- Come on, come on...
- Dolphins and cowboys.

264
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,296
<i>Griese to throw.</i>

265
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,506
<i>Incomplete.</i>

266
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,626
Come on! He was wide open.

267
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,176
<i>Seven-seven with 5:21</i>

268
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,256
<i>to play in the fourth.</i>

269
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,926
<i>Deep down the sidelines,</i>

270
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,346
<i>caught by Fleming at the seven</i>

271
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,716
<i>and thrown out of bounds by Harris.</i>

272
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,806
<i>A gain of 35 yards.</i>

273
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,686
<i>That's the big play Miami has
been looking for all afternoon.</i>

274
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,566
<i>First and goal with 4:48 remaining.</i>

275
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,026
<i>And of course, for
griese and the dolphins,</i>

276
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,896
<i>this is more than just a game.</i>

277
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,986
Hey, bud, where are you?

278
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,026
Dolphins are about to score.

279
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,366
<i>But make no mistake.</i>

280
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,196
- Hey, junior.
- They are still haunted

281
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,197
- <i>by losing to Dallas...
- Jun</i>

282
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,520
<i>two years ago in...</i>

283
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,860
<i>First and goal from the seven.</i>

284
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,166
Jesus!

285
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,360
Fuck!

286
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,826
Help!

287
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,430
Somebody! Help!

288
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,410
Dear god.

289
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,396
- Now, Doris. Doris.
- What happened?!

290
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,130
Doris, Doris, Doris.

291
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,896
I'm sorry, it was an accident, I... My baby.

292
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,680
I'm sorry.

293
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,640
Why?!

294
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,456
<i>For most fathers and sons,</i>

295
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,570
<i>a hunting trip is about bonding</i>

296
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,176
<i>about teaching your son the skills</i>

297
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,450
<i>to survive on his own.</i>

298
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,910
<i>For us, it was that. And more.</i>

299
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,550
<i>Harry knew I had specific needs.</i>

300
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,970
<i>And we tried everything
we could to control them.</i>

301
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,850
- Dad?
- I'm fine.

302
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,746
What'd you get? All right.

303
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,496
These look fresh.

304
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,466
It's been a while since
you bagged a boar.

305
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,530
Tracks look deep. Must be a big one.

306
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,046
So, what do you think?

307
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,910
Pork chops tonight or sliders?

308
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,386
- Dex?
- Dad...

309
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,306
These hunting trips don't
work for me anymore.

310
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,896
What do you mean?

311
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,026
Animals aren't enough.

312
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,236
These... feelings I have.

313
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,026
- I can't ignore them.
- No, no.

314
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,027
It's too soon.

315
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:30,236
You taught me the code

316
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,526
to help me channel my urges.

317
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,680
What's the point if I can't even use it?

318
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,536
Killing a person... It's not that simple.

319
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,876
Once you do it, it can't be undone.

320
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,296
I almost did.

321
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,916
- What?
- Kill someone.

322
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,256
Last night at the party.

323
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,966
What happened?

324
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,256
I promised Deb I wouldn't

325
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,217
- say anything.
- Come on, please.

326
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,346
I know she was drinking.

327
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,636
There was this guy.

328
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,516
He was trying to take advantage of her.

329
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,596
And?

330
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,056
I threw him down the stairs.

331
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,380
He hit me. I hit him back, but

332
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,146
then I saw his blood.

333
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,550
And everything became really clear.

334
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,720
There was a knife on the bar.

335
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,956
More than anything in my whole life,

336
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,230
I wanted to take that knife.

337
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,086
What stopped you?

338
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,376
Deb.

339
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
She yanked me off of him.

340
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,280
If it hadn't been for her, I...

341
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,216
Dad?

342
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,346
Dad!

343
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,000
God!

344
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,186
Help!

345
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,276
We need help here. Help!

346
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,156
- What's his name?
- Harry.

347
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,366
Any history of heart attacks?

348
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,116
- Prior surgery?
- No.

349
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,286
Dad? Dad?

350
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,980
I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna be okay.

351
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,206
Hang back here, hon.
Give us room to work.

352
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,666
I promise, we'll take good care of him.

353
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,336
For the first time, the
idea of death became...

354
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,780
<i>Excruciating.</i>

355
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,936
How can you fucking
eat at a time like this?

356
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,726
I could always eat at a time like this.

357
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,460
<i>But...</i>

358
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,146
You okay?

359
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,116
Of course I'm not fucking okay.

360
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,486
What if he doesn't make it, Dex?

361
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,866
I didn't get to see him this morning.

362
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:39,867
You guys left so early.

363
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:42,826
I never got a chance to say goodbye.

364
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,996
To tell him I love him.

365
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,956
<i>I was there.</i>

366
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,166
<i>And I didn't do that.</i>

367
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,456
Dad knows you love him, Deb.

368
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,456
That's not the point, Dex. God, you...

369
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,836
Here you are, dear.

370
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,940
Any update?

371
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,756
I'm sorry to say your father
suffered a heart attack.

372
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,926
My god.

373
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,386
But he's currently
stable and in great hands.

374
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,040
Okay, sweetheart?

375
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,856
You all can see him and the doctor now.

376
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,226
Your father's blood work indicates

377
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,606
he suffered a non-st-elevation
myocardial infarction.

378
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,816
Fuck does that mean?

379
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,986
Deb, language, come on.

380
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,946
It means I got a little blockage.

381
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,156
Nothing serious.

382
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,906
A few pills, I'm out of the woods, right?

383
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,906
Not quite. We're gonna need
to hold you for further testing.

384
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,326
All goes well, you could be
home by the end of the week.

385
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,916
But you're gonna need
to stick to a strict diet.

386
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,546
And quit fucking smoking.
Excuse my French.

387
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,756
Your French is excellent.

388
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,416
You're gonna want to manage stress,

389
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,926
of course, it's very important.

390
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,320
<i>Unfortunately, I was the stress.</i>

391
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,210
Hey, don't you have some,
like, big game coming up?

392
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,606
Regionals.

393
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,250
Don't know if I'm going.

394
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,776
Dad would want you to play.

395
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,066
Dad's not here.

396
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,946
Well, I am. I'll go to your game.

397
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,890
Just save me an aisle seat.

398
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,560
Wait, you actually want to
come to my volleyball game?

399
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,036
We're supposed to
support each other, right?

400
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,560
As a family?

401
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,746
What family?

402
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,836
Soon we won't even
need a fucking table.

403
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,506
Just two TV trays.

404
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,296
The doctor said he might
be out by the end of the week.

405
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,386
And then what? He's gonna
go right back to drinking

406
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,410
and smoking and all his
other self-destructive shit.

407
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,606
Look at all this crap.

408
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,236
No wonder his heart tried to peace out.

409
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,840
- Fuck.
- Deb... Stop.

410
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,157
It's gonna be okay.

411
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,050
That's what everyone
said before mom died.

412
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,600
Fuck!

413
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,570
Dex.

414
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:07,620
We should probably wipe
the floor before that dries.

415
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,210
Some fucking support, Dex.

416
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,766
<i>The next few days</i>

417
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,606
<i>of Harry's hospitalization were... Odd.</i>

418
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,720
<i>His condition didn't improve.</i>

419
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,326
<i>It was in those days that I realized</i>

420
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,640
<i>that grief is like an ocean.</i>

421
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,810
<i>Sometimes it's calm.</i>

422
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,530
<i>Other times the waves
can overwhelm you.</i>

423
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,346
<i>Times like that, people
say the best you can do</i>

424
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,670
<i>is just learn to swim.</i>

425
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,600
<i>But I planned to do so
much more than just swim.</i>

426
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,746
And that was when I
realized that nurse Mary

427
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:59,270
<i>just might be a fellow traveler.</i>

428
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,950
And how are we doing
this sunshiny day?

429
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,556
Why is my father getting worse?

430
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,240
Dear.

431
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,516
It's never easy seeing
a loved one in pain.

432
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,790
What is that you just gave him?

433
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,436
It's complicated.

434
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,186
Try me.

435
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,260
I'm pre-med.

436
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,406
Your father made a lifetime
of bad choices for his health.

437
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,350
This... this is the result.

438
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,956
So all we can do is give him
the medicine that he needs

439
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,770
to come out on the other side.

440
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,570
Don't worry. This too shall pass.

441
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,506
<i>It was then I decided</i>

442
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,870
<i>it wasn't Harry who was going to pass.</i>

443
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,656
Hello, dear. Can I help with anything?

444
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,520
I'm just kind of... lost.

445
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,576
Cute cat.

446
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,706
That's Mr. Tinker. Such a love.

447
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,836
I'd always had a kinship with cats.

448
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,240
<i>Nature's own serial killers.</i>

449
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,830
I've got to head down the hall.
If you need anything, just ask.

450
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,980
<i>Her trophies.</i>

451
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,070
<i>Every picture tells a story.</i>

452
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,856
Can I help you, Dexter?

453
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,960
I need to use the ion
mobility spectrometer.

454
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,446
I-It's for a finals project.

455
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,090
Help yourself. But I got a
class coming in 40 minutes.

456
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,966
High potassium nitrate levels.

457
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,950
I noticed that.

458
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,256
What would happen if this solution

459
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,240
were delivered to
someone intravenously?

460
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,580
At this dilution? Harmless.

461
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,226
But if administered repeatedly

462
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,750
over the course of several days

463
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,300
it could kill someone.

464
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,890
Thanks, Dr. Rivas.

465
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,946
Hey, how detectable
would that be in, say,

466
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,956
a forensics medical examination?

467
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,786
Nearly undetectable.

468
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,836
The body does a great
job of processing high levels

469
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,006
of potassium nitrate,
even while it kills you.

470
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,506
<i>I had been hanging around</i>

471
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,796
<i>a real-deal serial killer all this time.</i>

472
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,256
<i>I was hoping I'd get to practice
my own brand of bedside manner.</i>

473
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,886
<i>There she was,</i>

474
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,910
<i>in the halls of healing,
only death on her mind.</i>

475
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,476
<i>If I asked Harry to let her be my first kill,</i>

476
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,476
<i>he would have said no.</i>

477
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,236
<i>He was too protective... Of me.</i>

478
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,380
<i>The kill had to be his idea.</i>

479
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,470
Poor dear.

480
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,746
I think that the shots she's giving

481
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,310
are killing you. You're only getting worse.

482
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,110
Don't... let her.

483
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,466
All right, my brave little soldier.

484
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,176
Let's get this out of the way.

485
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,056
Wait.

486
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,830
Harry doesn't want the shot.

487
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,396
Harry's in a lot of pain.

488
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,516
I want the pain.

489
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,790
He wants the pain.

490
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,656
It was at that moment she revealed

491
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,736
<i>she also had a dark passenger.</i>

492
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,010
<i>More important.</i>

493
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,980
<i>Harry saw it, too.</i>

494
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:49,900
Doctor's not gonna be happy
that you're refusing your meds.

495
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,587
You can tell.

496
00:33:57,611 --> 00:33:58,846
She's killing you

497
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,080
with high levels of potassium nitrate.

498
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,410
Stop

499
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,460
her.

500
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,050
I'd been waiting to hear
those words for so long.

501
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,340
<i>Harry's been training me
for this moment for years.</i>

502
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,367
Whoa.

503
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:23,220
<i>Hey, I was new at this.</i>

504
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,810
<i>But tonight... Tonight's the night.</i>

505
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,956
I hate that I'm missing the game tonight.

506
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,336
Don't worry. Dex is taking your place.

507
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,160
No offense, dad, but you look like shit.

508
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:47,080
Go. Win it for me.

509
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,460
I'll be at the next one.

510
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,586
You never forget your first time.

511
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,086
<i>Mine was with an older woman.</i>

512
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,950
Mr. Tinker, where are you, kitty?

513
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,196
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

514
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,430
<i>give it up for your manatees!</i>

515
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,680
Debra Morgan!

516
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,940
I've been looking
through your photo album.

517
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,216
So many wonderful memories.

518
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,030
I hope you don't mind.

519
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,120
Are all your victims in here?

520
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,670
Let me help you with that.

521
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,340
Scream again and lose a tongue.

522
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,350
I helped them.

523
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,746
I took their pain away.

524
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,116
- They didn't ask you to do that.
- They didn't have to.

525
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,666
These goddamn people

526
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:22,086
drinking and smoking
till their hearts give out.

527
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,926
Slaves to their own compulsions.

528
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,296
Just look at your father.

529
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,466
I already lost my
mother. Harry's all I've got,

530
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,450
and you tried to take him away from me.

531
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,106
That was the first time I ever felt

532
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,300
<i>someone else's fear.</i>

533
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,130
<i>And I liked it.</i>

534
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,280
Got it!

535
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,126
<i>And it's Morgan for the kill!</i>

536
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,660
And the manatees win!

537
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,210
I really hate mosquitos.

538
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,216
<i>My first trophies.</i>

539
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,426
<i>I didn't know it then,</i>

540
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,950
<i>but it would end up
being a terrible mistake.</i>

541
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,396
<i>I stuck to dad's code.</i>

542
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,026
<i>The rules were there for a reason.</i>

543
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,936
<i>To protect us.</i>

544
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,236
<i>To keep the innocent safe.</i>

545
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:56,576
<i>And, most importantly
for me, to never get...</i>

546
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,390
<i>Caught.</i>

547
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,106
Who are you?

548
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,406
I live here.

549
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,776
- Hey, Dexter.
- Bobby.

550
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,906
Good to see you, kid. This is Harry's boy.

551
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,196
Dexter, it's so good to see you.

552
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,656
We're all pulling for your pop.

553
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,326
If there's anything you, your sister need,

554
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,866
just let me know, I'll
make it happen, okay?

555
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,456
Thanks.

556
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,086
How's that goddaughter of
mine handling everything?

557
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,626
You know.

558
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,506
Deb is... Deb.

559
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,546
- Yeah.
- What's all this?

560
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,046
Last thing you should be worrying about

561
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,546
is filling the fridge.

562
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,966
Yeah, and you know, I got

563
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,466
I told them half pepperoni.
You know, heart healthy.

564
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,846
Well, that's such a... <i>Relief.</i>

565
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,250
Nice gesture.

566
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,316
You can leave it all on the kitchen table.

567
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,236
There he is. D-man. D-Dawg.

568
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,866
Remember me from the job fair?
Was hoping we'd catch you here.

569
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,486
You, caught me.

570
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,406
I brought you kids
some hamburger helper.

571
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,826
My kids live off this stuff.

572
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,286
Dexter, meet Tanya Martin.

573
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,366
Aka "the boss lady of forensics."

574
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,036
I've heard a lot about you.

575
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,286
Really?

576
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,626
I've worked with Harry for years.

577
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,126
He's a great cop. Bet
he's taught you well.

578
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,626
<i>She had no idea.</i>

579
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,086
Dude, you had such great instincts

580
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,136
with those photos at the job fair.

581
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,466
Linking them to the same killer?

582
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,136
That's exactly what we thought.

583
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,676
Wow. Cool.

584
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,060
Turned out not to be true, though.

585
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,347
But it took us six weeks

586
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:45,306
to recognize the similarities.

587
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,266
You picked them out in six seconds.

588
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,686
I made a few calls.

589
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,726
Your professor, Dr. Rivas, told me

590
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,896
you're the most talented
student he's ever had.

591
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,736
Well, I don't know what to say.

592
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,616
Say yes, 'cause you've earned
yourself a job offer, d-money.

593
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,576
A paid internship.

594
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,850
$4.25 an hour.

595
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,850
Think about it.

596
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,626
<i>It was perfect timing.</i>

597
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,530
<i>I was starving after... well...</i>

598
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,256
- Hey.
- Hey.

599
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,676
Where were you all night?

600
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,886
Like you care.

601
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,136
I was at Sofia's.

602
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,226
Her parents took us out

603
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,386
to celebrate after the big game.

604
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,846
You know, the one that we won?

605
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,056
You know, the one that
you said you'd come to

606
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,936
but then blew off.

607
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,526
Deb... I didn't think
you'd really come anyway.

608
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,527
I'm sorry.

609
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:38,156
What's all this?

610
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,736
Dad's work friends dropped it off.

611
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,180
Well, wasn't that real
fucking thoughtful of them?

612
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,460
Congratulations, class of 1991.

613
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,760
<i>I didn't blame Deb for
missing my graduation.</i>

614
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,616
<i>After all, I hadn't come through for her.</i>

615
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,850
<i>I was alone, and somehow
that seemed appropriate.</i>

616
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,746
I thought you were mad at
me for missing your game.

617
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:37,030
I'm still royally pissed, but like you said

618
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,610
we're family.

619
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,256
I am gonna ream you
out tomorrow, though.

620
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,120
I mean, what a dick move.

621
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,290
<i>So, it was always about family.</i>

622
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,720
<i>What a concept.</i>

623
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,810
You did it.

624
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,480
Sorry, I couldn't find your
nurse for the life of me.

625
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,336
What were you two talking about?

626
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,980
About going home.

627
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,200
Okay.

628
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:29,306
It's too bad you had
to miss graduation, dad.

629
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,726
You should've seen
what a dope Dex was.

630
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,396
He just sat there with
his cap on like an idiot.

631
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,356
Everyone had already thrown theirs off.

632
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,896
Isn't that right, Dex?

633
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,226
I wish I could've seen it.

634
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,566
Well, your presence was felt.

635
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,026
I can't believe how much better you look.

636
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,300
It's almost a miracle.

637
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,156
Man.

638
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,366
Coming through.

639
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:53,180
I love it!

640
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,070
All right.

641
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,740
Whoo!

642
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,210
Anything I can get you?

643
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,816
No.

644
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,170
Okay. Well, if you need
anything in the night...

645
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,736
The nurse.

646
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,156
No witnesses?

647
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,890
None.

648
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,076
And, most importantly,

649
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,310
she'll never hurt anyone again.

650
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,206
What did you do with the body?

651
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:44,740
She'll... Never be found.

652
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,410
What did you do with it?

653
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,176
I wrapped her up,

654
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,476
stuck her in the back of the pickup

655
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,290
and drove out to interstate 75.

656
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,540
Alligator alley.

657
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,436
I dropped her in a
batch of hungry gators.

658
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,340
She was gone in seconds.

659
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,566
Dad, there's literally
nothing to worry about

660
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,510
because there's literally
nothing left of her.

661
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:15,956
How did it feel?

662
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,940
It felt

663
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,320
right.

664
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,466
Good night, son.

665
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,240
I'll see you in the morning.

666
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,620
Good night, dad.

667
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,480
<i>Change was never easy for Harry.</i>

668
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,126
I don't approve of you doing this, Dex.

669
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:07,506
<i>But I was at a point in my life
where change was necessary.</i>

670
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,676
You're always telling me
to be part of something.

671
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,096
<i>It was... good.</i>

672
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,200
This is me following my father's advice.

673
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,846
- Sarge.
- Angel.

674
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,056
Thank god.

675
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,106
Welcome back.

676
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,016
- Bobby.
- I knew you'd get through, pal.

677
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,146
Good to see you.

678
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,026
It's great to see you, sir.

679
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,776
Clark, good to see you, too.

680
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,026
Harry.

681
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,526
Camilla. Missed you.

682
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,010
Dexter, Doris would be so proud.

683
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,496
Hey, the place felt empty without you.

684
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,536
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

685
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,860
Missed you, too.

686
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:46,256
Another Morgan in the building.

687
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,160
Hopefully, you're not
a chip off the old block.

688
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,426
Nice haircut.

689
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,716
<i>My father was a man
with so many friends.</i>

690
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,016
<i>And I, well, I... wasn't.</i>

691
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,476
You're late, newbie.

692
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,710
- I am?
- I'm just shitting you.

693
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,866
Tanya.

694
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,276
Dexter.

695
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,406
Welcome to the first
day of the rest of your life.

696
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,036
I hope you'll be happy here.

697
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:22,076
I'm sure I will be.

698
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,786
I know you think you know it all,

699
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,086
but you've got a lot to learn, amigo.

700
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,770
Take a seat.

701
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,780
You get the little one.

702
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,596
<i>My new life.</i>

703
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,660
<i>Thought it might be a good
idea to take it for a spin.</i>
